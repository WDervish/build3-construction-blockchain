# âš— Substrate Framework

## Summary

substrate\_ is a Rust-based framework for building blockchains built on the foundation of [web3 foundation](https://www.web3.foundation) research.&#x20;

substrate\_ was used to build the [Polkadot network](http://www.polkadot.network).

{% hint style="info" %}
using substrate\_ as a framework creates interoperability with the Polkadot network but does not require integration with the Polkadot network. The framework can be used to build independent blockchain applications, including private blockchains.
{% endhint %}

Using `substrate_` requires knowledge of the `Rust` programming language, especially the idea of `generic types` and `trait bounding` .
