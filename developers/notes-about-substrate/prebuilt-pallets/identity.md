# ðŸ†” Identity

Federated naming system which allows multiple regisrars to be added from a specified origin.

Registrars can set a fee to provide an identify-verification service.&#x20;

Anyone can put forth a proposed identity for a fixed deposit and ask for a review by any number of registrars (paying each of their fees).

Registrar judgments are given as an enum, allowing for sophisticated, multi-tier opinions.
