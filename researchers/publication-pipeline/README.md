## Publication Instructions

### How do I Join an Authorship Team?

If you would like to join an Authorship Team (or submit a topic to request an Authorship Team), please [become a member](https://www.build3.foundation/members) (there are no fees), then join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/jJhp58PFA2). Once you are on the Discord server, we'll walk you through the process and get to work!

### What is an Authorship Team?

An authorship team must contain a minimum of one author and one editor. There may be multiples of either or multiples of both.&#x20;

#### Authorship Team

A team nominated and accepted to conduct research for a [Publication Request](./#publication-request) submitted by a Build3 Member. The Authorship Team must have a minimum of one [author ](./#author)and one [editor](./#editor).

#### Author

The authors are for producing the copy and all supporting documents, sources, images, and graphs. The author is responsible for delivering the research on time to ensure timely delivery of weekly updates to this website, a timely steady-state declaration, and on-time delivery of the final product submitted for approval to the network.&#x20;

#### Lead Author

If multiple authors are nominated, one must be titled the Lead Researcher, acting as the project manager. The Lead is ultimately responsible for all duties listed above. The Lead Research received credit for this role in the publication.

#### Editor

The editor is responsible for quality assurance. The editor reads each iteration of thought, looking for logical fallacies, technical inaccuracies, grammar or spelling issues, confirmation bias, relevance to build3 scope, and other elements to ensure a minimum standard of care for the publication.

The editor is responsible for merging all pull requests from the Author during the **Research Development** phase.

#### Publication Request

A Build3 Member-nominated request for publication. If accepted, Build3 lists this topic to the build3.network to help assemble an Authorship Team. Publication requests each have a unique identifier and are numbered in the order they are listed to the network (eg PR1, PR2, etc).&#x20;



### The Publication Process

The path toward publication will move along according to this cycle:

#### Step 1. Publication Request

A member submits publication requests for consideration into the curated list hosted on this page. Build3 adds approved publication requests to the next available nomination timeslot (each one week in length)&#x20;

#### Step 2. Author and Editor Nomination

Build3 Members nominate authors and editors for each publication; self-nomination is permitted (this may change). The foundation lists the publication request for one week, removing it after one week if no author is nominated and accepted. If there are no new publication requests in the queue at the end of the nomination slot, Build3 Members may vote on a previously unsuccessful publication request.&#x20;

#### Step 3. Maximum Topics Listed Per Nomination Cycle

Build3 limits the total publication requests to a maximum of 10 for each nomination slot.

#### Step 4. Research Development

The Build3 Foundation moves all successful proposals to the Active Research page, where the Authorship Team begins Research Development.

1. The Authorship Team must update their progress weekly so that Build3 Members may review and comment.
2. The authorship team is under no obligation to integrate the comments from the community.&#x20;
3. For the benefit of context for observing Members, the authorship team will respond to all rejected comments with their reasoning.&#x20;

#### **Step 5. Steady-State**

The Authorship Team must declare their work in a Steady-State two or more weeks before the final submission deadline. The Authorship Team will not submit additional significant changes or conclusions for projects announced in Steady-State.&#x20;

#### Step 6. Finalizing the Publication

The research team uses the time between steady-state and the deadline to formalize their findings in a technical white paper. The Authorship team submits its work on the pre-determined deadline.

1. **Pre-Final Vote:** Build3 Members vote to approve or reject the pre-final draft. Approvals and rejection votes may include notes to authors. Authors are under no obligation to address or reply to comments. The Authorship Team determines what changes to incorporate and submits any revisions for the final vote.
   1. Build3 members may nominate dissenting opinions to be included in the addendum of the final publication. Build3 members then vote on the inclusion of those nominated opinions.
   2. When the Authorship Team sponsors a dissenting opinion, it is automatically added to the addendum.
2. **Revised-Final Vote:** The Build3 Members vote on the revised final; comments are optional.&#x20;
   1. If approved, the Authorship Team may not modify the approved document.&#x20;
   2. If not approved, Build3 Members may not vote again for the submission.&#x20;
   3. A Build3 Member must submit the topic again as a research request and repeat the process to produce another voting round.
