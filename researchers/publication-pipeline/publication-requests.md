# ðŸ“¢ Publication Requests

## Overview

This page serves to curate the list of research requests and describe the publication workflows. Each item in the list of [publication requests](publication-requests.md#publication-request) is temporarily open to the public for the nomination of [Authorship Teams](publication-requests.md#what-is-an-authorship-team).&#x20;

To get started

1. Join the [Build3 Foundation](http://www.build3.foundation) as a member (no fees) to participate in authorship or nomination. Only members are authorized to nominate or become [authors ](publication-requests.md#author)and [editors ](publication-requests.md#editor)for teams. Members may also submit more topics for consideration.&#x20;
2. Join the [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/jJhp58PFA2) to get in touch with existing members.

This page may be updated occasionally based on community input.

And without further adieu, let's look at the topics open for authorship nomination:

## Publication Request List

Publications that do not receive an [author](publication-requests.md#author) and [editor](publication-requests.md#editor) nomination are subject to expiry. New proposals will replace expired submissions.

### PR3 | Authorship, not Ownership: Re-understanding and NFT&#x20;

#### Authorship Team:

**Author //** Bradley Edward Layton, PhD PE _\[pending acceptance]_

**Editor //** _\[awaiting nomination]_

<details>

<summary>PR3 | Click to Expand | Submitted 12 April 2022</summary>

### **Abstract**

A common problem articulated for NFTs is that they do nothing to assure ownership. Anyone can claim any digital asset and mint it as an NFT. This research aims to demonstrate the wholly overlooked use for an NFT: authorship.&#x20;

#### Example: Shop Drawing Submittal Review

Equipment manufacturers typically author these drawings. If necessary, the trade contractor then marks up the submittal to prepare the document for review. The licensed designer of record then authors their judgment against the submission and sends it back as either approved or denied (resubmission required). At no point in this chain was ownership relevant to the reason for this communication chain.

That process exists to verify compliance with the construction documents. Compliance with construction documents represents compliance with the highly regulated architectural and engineering design process. The highly regulated design process is in place to ensure compliance with the code, and the code's fundamental purpose is to protect public safety and welfare.&#x20;

Ownership of these documents is entirely irrelevant within this context. Nothing is more important than proof of authorship and compliance with previously authored construction records.

And so we ask ourselves, what is the name for proof of authorship on a blockchain? These authorship proofs belong to a contract. They are nonfungible in that no two authorship proofs can be considered equal. Unlike artwork or music, an authorship-based supervision compliance supply chain is strictly _nontransferrable._ The signed documents bind to the construction contract immutably, and the construction contract binds in perpetuity to the property.

### PR4 | Cryptographic Certificate of Occupancy

#### Authorship Team:

**Author //** _\[awaiting nomination]_

**Editor //** _\[awaiting nomination]_

<details>

<summary>PR4 | Click to Expand | Submitted 12 April 2022</summary>

### **Abstract**

With architectural and engineering seals, Construction Administration, permit review and approval, and inspections authorship proofs resolved, it isn't a stretch of the mind to consider the Certificate of Occupancy itself as fundamental to the blockchain. The building design and construction cycle would be tied together with minimal disruption to existing workflows, directly to the Occupancy Certificate.

This new cryptographic token will tie to the building identity and introduce new features for a certificate of occupancy that could never have previously existed. This topic encourages the authors' imagination to explore those new features and document them as formal technical specifications.

### PR5 | Blockchain Makes Everything Worse for Everyone in Every Industry

#### Authorship Team:

**Author //** _\[awaiting nomination]_

**Editor //** _\[awaiting nomination]_

<details>

<summary>PR5 | Click to Expand | Submitted 12 April 2022</summary>

### **Abstract**

This research aims to dig deeply into those advocating strongly against blockchain technology and web3 in general for ethical, economic, social, or other notable concerns. Relentlessly exploring dissenting opinions is vital to the rigor of the research and will shake loose existential threats overlooked due to confirmation bias. With those threats identified, Build3 can work to resolve or mitigate them within the protocol.

  * _The above claim is not necessarily valid. Build3 is about authorship, no ownership. This distinction is the fundamental difference between the criticisms (generally focused on flaws inherent to fintech and so claims typically reside in the claim that blockchain is the_ financialization _of all things). The distinction is vital: Build3 is concerned with authorship for construction supervision authority._

### PR6 | Turn a Nonprofit 503(c) into a Nonprofit DAO

#### Authorship Team:

**Author //** Kenneth Shultz, PE _\[accepted]_

**Editor //** _Phil Brock \[nominated]_

<details>

<summary>PR6 | Click to Expand | Submitted 12 April 2022</summary>

### **Abstract**

This paper will explore traditional bylaw language for registered 503(c) organizations and work to integrate them with on-chain governance. The board of directors will vote to approve or reject the newly proposed bylaws. If approved, The Build3 Foundation will submit the bylaws to the State Corporation Commission, included in the final product of this publication, and formally instantiate them on-chain through the substrate pallet configuration.&#x20;

Construct the paper-contract language such that blockchain governance authorizes all future bylaw changes. Consider conditions for catastrophic network failure. For example, members, a committee, or a board of directors may adopt new bylaws through traditional means. After network recovery, Build3 Foundation must register any off-chain measures adopted to the blockchain.&#x20;

The purpose is to finalize the Build3 Bylaws and publish findings for future organizations to use in consultation with their legal representation.
