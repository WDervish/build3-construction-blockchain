### Abstract

This publication will discuss the roadmap for implementing a public utility supervision blockchain. This research would discover the complete road map logically from easiest to most difficult to implement. An example features road map may look like this (or some variation):

1. **Professional Licensure Authorship:** Cryptographic Signatures representing Architectural and Engineering Seals. This functions as the start of the identity network (proof of licensee).
2. **Construction Submittals:** Cryptographically signed by the issuer and signed by the reviewer(s)
3. **Permitting:** Permits signed on-chain by the submitting parties and signed by the approving authority having jurisdiction.
   1. Note: topic also may include thoughts about the International Building Code, Chapter 1, or other written codes that address permitting requirements. Nothing technically changes about permit applications and approval other than adding the blockchain's underlying storage and authorship mechanism.
4. **Inspections & Occupancy Certificates:** Similar to permitting, but for proof of the inspection authority.
5. **Operations and Maintenance:**  This concept is starting to look much longer into the future but is worth thought and documentation. Is O\&M a standalone network interoperable through a Polkadot (or Polkadot-like) parachain? How does O\&M tie to the original record of construction supervision, permitting, and occupancy approval?
6. **Property Identity:** The contributions from the build3 network related to proof of supervision would be identity markers about a specific property. Each renovation from start to end of a building would contain evidence of the supervision process that helped to secure the safety of the building itself.
   1. This newly found record of building history may tie into COBie reports and digital twin applications.&#x20;
   2. The incremental move into this phase of adoption would introduce conversations about insurance and lending, two major parties in the industry which rely heavily on underwriting risk.
7. **GIS Maps:** Proof of supervision of land survey work tied directly to the public GIS map systems. This use case is quite an abstraction from our original use case of professional supervision. GIS Maps is included as an example to help stretch out as far as we can reach for our purpose of identifying code compliance at the start of a building lifecycle and how that can extend throughout until the end of life. The objective is to postulate the demolition of an ideally chain-documented building. The land remains, but the evidence of the building is gone or nearly gone; however, the blockchain persists as a historical artifact.

Introduction

We are living in the times of great transformation, enabled by the invent of blockchain. It is the technology fueling what is considered by many to be the 4th Industrial Revolution. I would like to call it transformation; it is the digitization of value, identity,intellectual and tangible assets. It is making its way into most aspects of our lives.

The idea of blockchain has been around as early as ..but it made its mark more prominent little longer than a decade ago,when Bitcoin was released in 2009. The technology has been mainly reshaping the financial industry, it started to be implemented in real-estate, healthcare and supply chain management of various goods in global trade.  What makes blockchain stand-out is that it exhibits the three main qualities necessary to run a trust-less system.These qualities include: (i) being indelible; (ii) globally readable; and (iii) having strictly ordered transaction records.   These qualities give BTC holders the assurance that the tokens they are receiving or spending have track records back to their inceptions, and that these tokens are genuine. 

It is revolutionary in the sense that it removes the third party that one would need in the old system; in this case banks. Banks at their cores are essentially book keepers; keeping track of who has what, in what form, the amount.With blockchain, such crucial information is out there on the globally readable ledger for anybody to see.

Bitcoin demonstrates that value (i.e., money in this case) can be transferred into a digitized token and used in commerce without the need for a third party verification. Least assured, its capabilities extend beyond finance â€¦ This paper will attempt to show few ways of how to harness blockchain for public use and good.
