# üê≥ Research Development

This is the active repository for recently accepted [Publication Requests](../). Research Development is the active playground of the Authorship Team where you are encouraged to watch and engage with the authors about their research.

What you'll find here are the early ideas, sketches, notes, and slow formation of ideas articulating into formal research. The next stop after this phase is conversion to a final technical white paper format. All Research Development projects are subject to Build3 Membership voting approval.&#x20;

Members are encouraged to comment and offer feedback as these projects develop. If you are not a formal author, you are still a member, and your contribution matters.&#x20;
