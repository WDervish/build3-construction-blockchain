# ðŸ“¢ Proposed Publications

## Overview

The Build3 Foundation receives all contributions to research and development from the open-source community. We are actively looking for researchers to collaborate on publications, and this list represents a few topics on our schedule to integrate into formal research.

The path toward publication will move along according to this cycle:

1. Propose idea and abstract to be added to this curated list.
2. The authorship team is identified for a topic. An authorship team may include organizations and individuals.
3. The authorship team organizes and publishes their ideas on this website as proof of concept research. This will allow flexibility to build ideas while sharing them in their transient state.
4. Once the idea has reached steady-state on this documentation website, it will be converted into a formal, technical white paper and published as free and open-source for the community's benefit.

Interested in contributing to publications? Just [reach out on our Discord ](https://discord.gg/jJhp58PFA2)and we'll work to connect you with the right team of researchers.

## Research Topics

<details>

<summary>How Long Will Adoption Take? A roadmap.</summary>

A proposed publication to discuss the roadmap for implementing a public utility supervision blockchain. This research would discover the full road map in a logical order from easiest to most difficult to implement. An example features road map may look like this:

1\. **Professional Licensure Authorship:** Cryptographic Signatures representing Architectural and Engineering Seals. This functions as the start of the identity network as well (proof of licensee).\
2\. **Construction Submittals:** Cryptographically signed by the issuer and signed by the reviewer(s)\
3\. **Permitting:** Permits signed on-chain by the submitting parties and signed by the approving authority having jurisdiction. This topic also requires thinking about the International Building Code, Chapter 1, or other codes are written that address permitting requirements.\
4\. **Inspections:** Similar to permitting, but for proof of the state of inspection.\
5\. **Maintenance:**  This may be discussed as an interoperable parachain on the Polkdatot network or some other parachain based network that could share state and security with the build3 network.\
6\. **Property Identity:** The contributions from the build3 network related to proof of supervision would be identity markers about a specific property. Each renovation from start to end of a building would contain the proof of supervision process that helped to secure the safety of the building itself. This would have insurability implications worth researching.\
7\. **GIS Maps:** Proof of supervision of land survey work which would be tied directly to the public GIS map systems.

<summary>Labor Based Based Voting Power</summary>

Blockchain enthusiasts usually tout the benefits of decentralization. Unfortunately, many of the features baked into the technology ultimately lead to a re-centralization in myriad ways. A small [central group of miner farms](https://www.sunbirddcim.com/infographic/largest-bitcoin-mining-farms-world) generally controls all rewards on the bitcoin network. When it comes to voting mechanisms, most involve the spending of coins, which makes voter authority directly proportional to their access to funds.&#x20;

A proposed solution to this problem involves removing or reducing the possibility of exponential relationships from voting power. Non-transferrable voting tokens are issues based on a user's contribution to the network. You earn voting tokens as you review, submit, or otherwise interact with the system. These tokens are non-transferrable, would be burned when used for voting, and may expire after some time. This paper will explore these ideas and propose technical standards for developers to implement as a pallet on the chain. This voting token introduces a new token that is not nonfungible (NFT) nor technically wholly fungible.

<summary>Construction Administration on Public Utility Construction Ledger</summary>

Construction drawings generally require submittals such as product data, shop drawings, product samples, and other elements. Each contractor on the job must submit the specified deliverables in order to conform to the specifications of the supervised construction documents. \
\
With a public utility construction ledger, these submittals would be tied to the construction project and must be signed by the issuer. This centralizes access to the submittal data, demonstrates proof of time passed between submission and reviewn and most importantly offers proof of authorship. The engineer of record has proof that the author of the submittal is the contractor performing the work, and the contractor has proof that the engineer of record is the author of the review or approval.

<summary>Cryptographic Certificate of Occupancy</summary>

With architectural and engineering seals, Construction Administration, permit review and approval, and inspections authorship proofs resolved, it isn't a stretch of the mind to consider the Certificate of Occupancy itself as fundamental to the blockchain. The building design and construction cycle would be tied together with minimal disruption to existing workflows, directly to the Occupancy Certificate.

This new cryptographic token will tie to the building identity and introduce new features for a certificate of occupancy that could never have previously existed. This topic encourages the authors' imagination to explore those new features and document them as formal technical specifications.
