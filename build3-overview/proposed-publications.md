# ðŸ“¢ Proposed Publications

## Overview

The following is a list of topics we are interested in exploring more deeply. We are always looking for more research support, [reach out on our Discord ](https://discord.gg/jJhp58PFA2)if you would like to learn more about contributing to Build3 Foundation.



<details>

<summary>How Long Will Adoption Take?</summary>

A proposed publication to discuss the roadmap for implementing a public utility supervision blockchain. This topic should cover how the language in the industry would need to adapt the existing legal framework (e.g. International Building Code, Chapter 1, AIA contracts, etc.) to the new ledger protocols. It would discuss the proposed least-resistance paths, how long each phase would take, and who would be critical in collaboration.

<summary>Labor Based Based Voting Power</summary>

Blockchain enthusiasts usually tout the benefits of decentralization. Unfortunately, many of the features baked into the technology ultimately lead to a re-centralization in myriad ways. A small [central group of miner farms](https://www.sunbirddcim.com/infographic/largest-bitcoin-mining-farms-world) generally controls all rewards on the bitcoin network. When it comes to voting mechanisms, most involve the spending of coins, which makes voter authority directly proportional to their access to funds.&#x20;

A proposed solution to this problem involves removing or reducing the possibility of exponential relationships from voting power. Non-transferrable voting tokens are issues based on a user's contribution to the network. You earn voting tokens as you review, submit, or otherwise interact with the system. These tokens are non-transferrable, would be burned when used for voting, and may expire after some time. This paper will explore these ideas and propose technical standards for developers to implement as a pallet on the chain. This voting token introduces a new token that is not nonfungible (NFT) nor technically wholly fungible.

<summary>Construction Administration on Public Utility Construction Ledger</summary>

Construction drawings generally require submittals such as product data, shop drawings, product samples, and other elements. Each contractor on the job must submit the specified deliverables in order to conform to the specifications of the supervised construction documents. \
\
With a public utility construction ledger, these submittals would be tied to the construction project and must be signed by the issuer. This centralizes access to the submittal data, demonstrates proof of time passed between submission and reviewn and most importantly offers proof of authorship. The engineer of record has proof that the author of the submittal is the contractor performing the work, and the contractor has proof that the engineer of record is the author of the review or approval.
