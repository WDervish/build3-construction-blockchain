# ðŸ’¡ A Working Solution

The build3.foundation has a working prototype of provable authorship engineering supervision. These prototypes show a proof of concept that we can secure the network.&#x20;

Our position at build3.foundation is that ethics bind the industry to commit to research and participation since we can now secure the network.

### How the Industry Can Help

We are not asking for building consulting engineers to become software engineers. There are tons of areas we need help with in terms of publication:

* [International Code Council:](https://webstore.ansi.org) We would enjoy the chance to work together to collaborate on language for&#x20;
  * Chapter 1, IBC permitting. This type of modification would help give guidance at the state level.
  * Section 116 (Certificate of Occupancy): with a secure network of proof of authorship, a C of O becomes a multi-signature transfer record.&#x20;
  * For example, an inspector would _prove_ from a cell phone that the document used for a permit does hash to the signature patterns of the engineer of record and plan reviewer. If it did not, they simply would not have the authorization to issue the certificate.&#x20;
* [American Institute for Architects](https://www.aia.org/?gclid=CjwKCAiAg6yRBhBNEiwAeVyL0KCLn6ddU38brlSGmC7W7M4Slekr8nbvV9RAJg-NK-lvBjHDUs56rBoC6vEQAvD\_BwE):  We have ideas for the AIA master contract and master spec.&#x20;
  * The professionals can use blockchain to manage submittal and shop drawing requirements. We can now prove that some specific party is the author of any particular document. This authorship proof applies to our licenses but also signatures in general during Construction Administration
* more to come...

Blockchain makes it near impossible to make fraudulent engineering judgments with invalid credentials. More on that later. For now, look around at where we are in the documentation. This website serves as a living and breathing documentation of where we are now and where we plan to be.

We will soon release our source code, open-source, and welcome any feedback and new collaborators.

Thank you,

build3.foundation
