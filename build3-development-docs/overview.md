# ðŸ§‘ðŸš€ Overview

## The framework selected should be <mark style="color:green;">secure</mark>, <mark style="color:green;">permanent</mark>, <mark style="color:green;">immutable</mark>, <mark style="color:orange;">fast</mark>, <mark style="color:orange;">extensible</mark>, <mark style="color:orange;">modular</mark>, and <mark style="color:purple;">interoperable</mark>.

### <mark style="color:green;">Secure</mark>: Rust

The core should be developed in a trusted, secure programming language,  called [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) ([check our quick-start guide](https://permitzip.gitbook.io/building-blockchain-applications/v/rust-study/)).

### <mark style="color:orange;">Fast, Extensible, Modular</mark>: substrate\_

{% hint style="success" %}
Using `substrate_` allows us to quickly build radically new implementations of long-trusted standards and protocols. substrate\_ is an out-of-the-box blockchain building framework.

`Also:`

* `substrate_` is written in rust.
* `substrate_` compiles to WASM for highly portable runtimes. (the language of all modern web browsers).
{% endhint %}

### <mark style="color:purple;">Interoperable</mark>: Polkadot

{% hint style="success" %}
Polkadot is a new blockchain network that turns blockchain into a multi-threaded multi-core processor.
{% endhint %}

Key strengths in the Polkadot network:

* Building with `substrate_` also allows the opportunity to share network security with the [Polkadot.Network](https://polkadot.network) in the form of a parachain or parathread.
* Polkadot itself was built with `substrate_.`
* `Both` `Polkadot` and `substrate_` we made open source through the work of the world-renowned [web3.foundation](https://web3.foundation).
* Polkadot will host multiple blockchains serving multiple purposes increasing the interoperability of web3 applications.

{% hint style="success" %}
Polkadot (and similar substrate\_ based blockchains) will make it easy for users and developers to interact with with different services on different chains such as

* insurance providers
* deed of trust record keepers
* legal services
* underwriting, etc.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
#### Don't want to be on Polkadot? Not a problem.

Any application built with `substrate_` can easily be configured to operate _<mark style="color:orange;">****</mark>** completely independently**_ from the Polkadot.Network.
{% endhint %}

### <mark style="color:green;">Permanent</mark> and <mark style="color:green;">Immutable</mark>: IPFS

{% hint style="warning" %}
this proposed standard is still undergoing research but serves as an example of the kind of need and the kind of solution.
{% endhint %}

IPFS is a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol intended to serve as a functionally **immutable permanent record**.&#x20;

IPFS (or a similar protocol) would&#x20;

* allow "proof" that a document was the formal record document and
* that it was signed by a verifiable authority of record.&#x20;
