# üèÉ‚ôÇ Runtime

There's so much ground to cover, but let's focus on runtime because that's where most of your time: how the runtime works and is constructed.

The `runtime` is built using `FRAME Pallets` as a plugin system. Between the `Pallets` and the `Runtime` crates, we have been able to create a working prototype of proof of supervision applicable to the construction industry.

Explore our [work in progress use cases](broken-reference) for build3 if you want a quick look at what is being proposed and how we plan to use the technology.
