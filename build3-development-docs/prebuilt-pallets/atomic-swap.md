# âš› Atomic Swap

This is traditionally used for token exchange but could be considered as a starting point to allowing someone to limit the length of time their work is up for review.

Perhaps the claim starts as being offered to a specific preferred reviewer, but then once expired, broadcasts to the network that the offer is now up for grab.
