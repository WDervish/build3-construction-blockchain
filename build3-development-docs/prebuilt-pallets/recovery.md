# ðŸŒ„ Recovery

The recovery pallet is an M-of-N social recovery tool for users to gain access to their accounts if authentication is lost.

A user is able to make calls on behalf of another account whcih they have recovered.

The recovery process is protected by trusted "friends" whom the original account owner chooses.

A threshold (M) out of N friends are needed to give another account access to the recoverable.
