# 👨🏫 Proxy

A pallet that allows accounts to give permission to other accounts to dispatch types of calls from their signed origin.

The accounts to which permission is delegated may be required to announce the action that they wish to execute some duration prior to execution happens. In this case, the target account may reject the announcement and in doing so, veto the execution.
