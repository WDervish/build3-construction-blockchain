# ðŸŒŒ Off-chain Worker

Inspired by [this use case](https://docs.substrate.io/v3/concepts/off-chain-features/#:\~:text=Off%2Dchain%20workers,-Off%2Dchain%20workers\&text=A%20fully%2Dfeatured%20HTTP%20client,between%20all%20off%2Dchain%20workers.) with additional reference materials.

An Off-chain worker can be used to process computationally complex transactions with larger bandwidth or data tansmission requirements.

An off-chain worker may be considered as a candidate that can download a large document from [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) and perform a hash to verify the authenticity of the remote-hosted document.
