### Abstract

This publication will discuss the roadmap for implementing a public utility supervision blockchain. This research would discover the complete road map logically from easiest to most difficult to implement. An example features road map may look like this (or some variation):

1. **Professional Licensure Authorship:** Cryptographic Signatures representing Architectural and Engineering Seals. This functions as the start of the identity network (proof of licensee).
2. **Construction Submittals:** Cryptographically signed by the issuer and signed by the reviewer(s)
3. **Permitting:** Permits signed on-chain by the submitting parties and signed by the approving authority having jurisdiction.
   1. Note: topic also may include thoughts about the International Building Code, Chapter 1, or other written codes that address permitting requirements. Nothing technically changes about permit applications and approval other than adding the blockchain's underlying storage and authorship mechanism.
4. **Inspections:** Similar to permitting, but for proof of the inspection authority.
5. **Operations and Maintenance:**  This concept is starting to look much longer into the future but is worth thought and documentation. Is O\&M a standalone network interoperable through a Polkadot (or Polkadot-like) parachain? How does O\&M tie to the original record of construction supervision, permitting, and occupancy approval?
6. **Property Identity:** The contributions from the build3 network related to proof of supervision would be identity markers about a specific property. Each renovation from start to end of a building would contain evidence of the supervision process that helped to secure the safety of the building itself.
   1. This newly found record of building history may tie into COBie reports and digital twin applications.&#x20;
   2. The incremental move into this phase of adoption would introduce conversations about insurance and lending, two major parties in the industry which rely heavily on underwriting risk.
7. **GIS Maps:** Proof of supervision of land survey work tied directly to the public GIS map systems. This use case is quite an abstraction from our original use case of professional supervision. GIS Maps is included as an example to help stretch out as far as we can reach for our purpose of identifying code compliance at the start of a building lifecycle and how that can extend throughout until the end of life. The objective is to postulate the demolition of an ideally chain-documented building. The land remains, but the evidence of the building is gone or nearly gone; however, the blockchain persists as a historical artifact.

### 2 | Labor-Based Based Voting Authority

#### Authorship Team:

### **Abstract**

Blockchain enthusiasts usually tout the benefits of decentralization. Unfortunately, many of the features baked into the technology ultimately lead to a re-centralization in myriad ways. A small [central group of miner farms](https://www.sunbirddcim.com/infographic/largest-bitcoin-mining-farms-world) generally controls all rewards on the bitcoin network. When it comes to voting mechanisms, most involve the spending of coins, which makes voter authority directly proportional to their access to funds.&#x20;

A proposed solution to this problem involves removing or reducing the possibility of exponential relationships from voting power. Non-transferrable voting tokens are issues based on a user's contribution to the network. You earn voting tokens as you review, submit, or otherwise interact with the system. These tokens are non-transferrable, would be burned when used for voting, and may expire after some time. This paper will explore these ideas and propose technical standards for developers to implement as a pallet on the chain. This voting token introduces a new token that is not nonfungible (NFT) nor technically wholly fungible.

### 3 | Authorship, not Ownership: Re-understanding and NFT&#x20;

#### Authorship Team:

**Author //** Bradley Edward Layton, PhD PE _\[pending acceptance]_

**Editor //** _\[awaiting nomination]_

<summary>Expand to Read More [Submitted 12 April 2022]</summary>

### **Abstract**

A common problem articulated for NFTs is that they do nothing to assure ownership. Anyone can claim any digital asset and mint it as an NFT. This research aims to demonstrate the wholly overlooked use for an NFT: authorship.&#x20;

#### Example: Shop Drawing Submittal Review

Equipment manufacturers typically author these drawings. If necessary, the trade contractor then marks up the submittal to prepare the document for review. The licensed designer of record then authors their judgment against the submission and sends it back as either approved or denied (resubmission required). At no point in this chain was ownership relevant to the reason for this communication chain.

That process exists to verify compliance with the construction documents. Compliance with construction documents represents compliance with the highly regulated architectural and engineering design process. The highly regulated design process is in place to ensure compliance with the code, and the code's fundamental purpose is to protect public safety and welfare.&#x20;

Ownership of these documents is entirely irrelevant within this context. Nothing is more important than proof of authorship and compliance with previously authored construction records.

And so we ask ourselves, what is the name for proof of authorship on a blockchain? These authorship proofs belong to a contract. They are nonfungible in that no two authorship proofs can be considered equal. Unlike artwork or music, an authorship-based supervision compliance supply chain is strictly _nontransferrable._ The signed documents bind to the construction contract immutably, and the construction contract binds in perpetuity to the property.

### 4 | Cryptographic Certificate of Occupancy

#### Authorship Team:

<summary>Expand to Read More [Submitted 12 April 2022]</summary>

### **Abstract**

With architectural and engineering seals, Construction Administration, permit review and approval, and inspections authorship proofs resolved, it isn't a stretch of the mind to consider the Certificate of Occupancy itself as fundamental to the blockchain. The building design and construction cycle would be tied together with minimal disruption to existing workflows, directly to the Occupancy Certificate.

This new cryptographic token will tie to the building identity and introduce new features for a certificate of occupancy that could never have previously existed. This topic encourages the authors' imagination to explore those new features and document them as formal technical specifications.

### **Abstract**

This research aims to dig deeply into those advocating strongly against blockchain technology and web3 in general for ethical, economic, social, or other notable concerns. Relentlessly exploring dissenting opinions is vital to the rigor of the research and will shake loose existential threats overlooked due to confirmation bias. With those threats identified, Build3 can work to resolve or mitigate them within the protocol.

### 6 | Legal Context: Connecting On-Chain Governance to State-Recognized Paper Bylaws

#### Authorship Team:

**Author //** Kenneth Shultz, PE _\[accepted]_

**Editor //** _\[awaiting nomination]_

<details>

<summary>Expand to Read More [Submitted 12 April 2022]</summary>

### **Abstract**

This paper will explore traditional bylaw language for registered 503(c) organizations, and work to adapt them such that they can be updated through the blockchain governance. The final bylaws, once approved by the board of directors, will be published as part of the research and be registered with the State Corporation Commission. The bylaws will also be formally instantiated on-chain through the on-chain governance mechanisms.&#x20;

The language should be worded in such a way that all future changes to the bylaws shall be registered through the blockchain protocols. There should be considerations for catastrophic failure in the chain to compensate for the risk of early adoption. For example: in the event of a catastrophic failure, the acting authorities of the organization may adopt new bylaws through traditional means. Those means must be registered to the blockchain once the network failure has been resolved.

The purpose is to both finalize the Build3 Bylaws and publish findings for future organizations to use in consultation with their legal representation.

## Publication Instructions

### How do I Join an Authorship Team?

If you would like to join an Authorship Team (or submit a topic to request an Authorship Team), please first [become a member](https://www.build3.foundation/members) (there are no fees), then join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/jJhp58PFA2). Once you are on the Discord server, we'll walk you through the process and get to work!

### What is an Authorship Team?

An authorship team must contain a minimum of one author and one editor. There may be multiples of either or multiples of both.&#x20;

#### Author

The authors are for producing the copy and all supporting documents, sources, images, and graphs. The author is responsible for delivering the research on time to ensure timely delivery of weekly updates to this website, a timely steady-state declaration, and on-time delivery of the final product submitted for approval to the network.&#x20;

If multiple authors are nominated, one must be titled the Lead Researcher, acting as the project manager. The Lead is ultimately responsible for all duties listed above. The Lead Research is listed first on the publication and is credited with these additional responsibilities on the publication.

#### Editor

The editor is responsible for quality assurance. The editor reads each iteration of thought looking for logical fallacies, technical inaccuracies, grammar or spelling issues, confirmation bias, relevance to build3 scope, and other elements to ensure a minimum standard of care for the publication.

The editor is responsible for merging all pull requests from the Author during the **Research Development** phase.

### The Publication Process

The path toward publication will move along according to this cycle:

1. **Topic Nomination:** A topic is nominated for consideration by the Build3 Foundation. The submitting party may nominate themselves.&#x20;
2. **Author Nomination:** The topic proposal will be listed for up to one week. It may be removed if no author and editor are nominated within that time period.
3. **Maximum Topics Listed:** Only ten research requests may be posted at a time.
4. **Topic Removal:** Once either 1.) at least one author and one editor have accepted the nomination and have committed to a publication deadline, or 2.) the listing has expired, the topic is removed from the Research Requests page.&#x20;
5. **Research Development:** The topic is then moved to the Active Research Projects page.&#x20;
   1. Where the research progress must be updated a minimum of once weekly to allow for user review and comment. The authorship team is under no obligation to accept comments from the community on the work. This allows for other members to engage in the progress and give the authors constructive feedback during the process.
6. **Steady-State:** The documentation must be declared as in 'steady state' meaning no significant changes to claims, or conclusions are permitted for this research period.&#x20;
   1. Steady-state must be declared at least two weeks prior to the formal publication deadline.&#x20;
7. **Finalizing the Publication:** The research team used the time between steady-state and the deadline to formalize their findings in a technical white paper.
   1. The final paper will be submitted to the network for approval. Comments may be submitted, but the authors are under no obligation to address them.
   2. If approved, be publication will be published as free and open-source (granting rights to the public to print, distribute, and make derivative work, without limitation) to the Build3 Foundation research repository.
