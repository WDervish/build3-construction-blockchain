# â„¹ Important Links

{% hint style="info" %}
When applicable, each heading is a link to take you to the additional knowledgebase resource.
{% endhint %}

## membership: [build3.foundation](https://www.build3.foundation)

This is the foundation landing page and the place where members can officially join the foundation. This page hosts forums, blogs, membership, and events.

The web page also serves as the main first-time-viewer landing page. A one-pager intended to articulate the mission succinctly.&#x20;

## documentation: [**build3.network**](https://www.build3.network)

The knowledgebase.

This is an evolving knowledge base of our active work, ideas, and other plans. We use gitbook because it offers developer documentation tools in a super simple way for non-developers to contribute thoughts and ideas.&#x20;

This is where a lot of preliminary ideas for governance, game theory, use-case applications, technical specifications, tutorials, and other information about the network will be published.

As the ideas grow more and more stable, they would then be converted into the formal white paper documentation for the [build3.foundation](https://www.build3.foundation) website or [GitHub](https://github.com/build3foundation) as a stable release for production.

This is where the ideas start to organize and develop into the formal and final technical specifications.&#x20;

Contributing is easy - just [join the discord](https://discord.com/invite/jJhp58PFA2) and ask how you can get involved!

## **governance: build3.dao**

Front end for build3 governance. There is no development on this yet, but eventually will be a React-based front-end application rendering the governance features of the build3 foundation.

All our governance work is backend only. If you want to get involved with the front end,[ **let us know!**](https://discord.com/invite/jJhp58PFA2)****

## **block explorer: build3.x**

Front end for build3 transactions. No development here, but the front-end would render whatever features the particular user needs to interact with the blockchain.

All our transactions are backend only. If you want to get involved with the front end,[ **let us know!**](https://discord.com/invite/jJhp58PFA2)

## funding with services: [b**uild3.com**](http://build3.com)

This just forwards to [build3.foundation](http://build3.foundation) right now.&#x20;

The idea behind this domain is to provide a road map for future funding of continued research in areas of blockchain for the industry.&#x20;

The .com domain would be the home of paid features similar to the relationship between [wordpress.org](http://wordpress.org) and [wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com) or MongoDB vs MongoDB's Atlas service.

## community: [**Discord**](https://discord.com/invite/jJhp58PFA2)

The home of day-to-day communications about active research projects to spare the inbox.

## source code: [**GitHub**](https://github.com/build3foundation)

Build3 repositories are on GitHub. We haven't made everything public yet - stay tuned!
