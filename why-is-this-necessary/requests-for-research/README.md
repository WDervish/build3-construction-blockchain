## Overview

The Build3 Foundation receives all contributions to research and development from the open-source community. We are actively looking for researchers to collaborate on publications, and this list represents a few topics on our schedule to integrate into formal research.

### How to Contribute to Research&#x20;

[Reach out on our Discord ](https://discord.gg/jJhp58PFA2)and we'll work to connect you with the right team of researchers.

## Proposed Research Topics

<summary>Build3 Blockchain Adoption Roadmap and Challenges</summary>

#### Nominated Authorship Team:&#x20;

#### **\[awaiting nomination]**

### Abstract

A proposed publication to discuss the roadmap for implementing a public utility supervision blockchain. This research would discover the full road map in a logical order from easiest to most difficult to implement. An example features road map may look like this:

1. **Professional Licensure Authorship:** Cryptographic Signatures representing Architectural and Engineering Seals. This functions as the start of the identity network as well (proof of licensee).
2. **Construction Submittals:** Cryptographically signed by the issuer and signed by the reviewer(s)
3. **Permitting:** Permits signed on-chain by the submitting parties and signed by the approving authority having jurisdiction. This topic also requires thinking about the International Building Code, Chapter 1, or other codes are written that address permitting requirements.
4. **Inspections:** Similar to permitting, but for proof of the state of inspection.
5. **Maintenance:**  This may be discussed as an interoperable parachain on the Polkdatot network or some other parachain based network that could share state and security with the build3 network.
6. **Property Identity:** The contributions from the build3 network related to proof of supervision would be identity markers about a specific property. Each renovation from start to end of a building would contain the proof of supervision process that helped to secure the safety of the building itself. This would have insurability implications worth researching.
7. **GIS Maps:** Proof of supervision of land survey work which would be tied directly to the public GIS map systems.

<summary>Labor Based Based Voting Authority</summary>

#### Nominated Authorship Team:&#x20;

#### **Phillip Brock, Author**

**Ken Shultz, Editor**

### **Abstract**

Blockchain enthusiasts usually tout the benefits of decentralization. Unfortunately, many of the features baked into the technology ultimately lead to a re-centralization in myriad ways. A small [central group of miner farms](https://www.sunbirddcim.com/infographic/largest-bitcoin-mining-farms-world) generally controls all rewards on the bitcoin network. When it comes to voting mechanisms, most involve the spending of coins, which makes voter authority directly proportional to their access to funds.&#x20;

A proposed solution to this problem involves removing or reducing the possibility of exponential relationships from voting power. Non-transferrable voting tokens are issues based on a user's contribution to the network. You earn voting tokens as you review, submit, or otherwise interact with the system. These tokens are non-transferrable, would be burned when used for voting, and may expire after some time. This paper will explore these ideas and propose technical standards for developers to implement as a pallet on the chain. This voting token introduces a new token that is not nonfungible (NFT) nor technically wholly fungible.

<summary>Why Authorship Matters in Construction Administration</summary>

#### Nominated Authorship Team:&#x20;

#### **\[awaiting nomination]**

### **Abstract**

Construction drawings generally require submittals such as product data, shop drawings, product samples, and other elements. Each contractor on the job must submit the specified deliverables in order to conform to the specifications of the supervised construction documents.&#x20;

We currently have no way to determine whether the architect or engineer is reviewing the exact same information submitted by the author (usually a trade contractor).\
\
The submittals are tied to the construction project and are signed by the issuer(s) as well as the reviewers(s). The designer of record has proof that the author of the submittal is the contractor performing the work, and the contractor has proof that the engineer of record is the author of the review or approval.

This mechanism also provides proof of compliance with specifications. It is now possible to prove if submittals were given to and approved by appropriate supervising authorities before construction was permitted.&#x20;

The public authorship proof lends to transparency and accountability in this system would increase the likelihood of code-compliant installation ultimately having the effect of increasing security for building occupants.

<summary>Cryptographic Certificate of Occupancy</summary>

#### Nominated Authorship Team:&#x20;

#### **\[awaiting nomination]**

### **Abstract**

With architectural and engineering seals, Construction Administration, permit review and approval, and inspections authorship proofs resolved, it isn't a stretch of the mind to consider the Certificate of Occupancy itself as fundamental to the blockchain. The building design and construction cycle would be tied together with minimal disruption to existing workflows, directly to the Occupancy Certificate.

This new cryptographic token will tie to the building identity and introduce new features for a certificate of occupancy that could never have previously existed. This topic encourages the authors' imagination to explore those new features and document them as formal technical specifications.

<summary>Five Reasons Blockchain Will Make Everything Worse</summary>

#### Nominated Authorship Team:&#x20;

#### **\[awaiting nomination]**

### **Abstract**

The purpose of this research is to dig deeply into those advocating strongly against blockchain technology, and web3 in general, for ethical, economic, social, or other notable concerns. This will encourage our organization to understand the existential threats technology presents. With those threats identified, Build3 can work to resolve or mitigate them within the protocol.

This paper is particularly interesting as it poses a great threat to Build3 claims and may serve to disprove them and dismantle the work completed to date to advance the technology. That being said, it's better to learn that sooner than later.

  * From the website, "Web3 is a web of ownership. Every object is owned by someone, every object can be traded to someone else."&#x20;
  * _The above claim is not necessarily true. Build3 is about authorship, no ownership. This is a fundamental difference between the criticisms (generally focused on flaws inherent to fintech and so claims generally reside in the claim that blockchain is the finacialization of all things). It must be differentiated: Build3 is concerned with authorship for the purposes of construction supervision authority._

## The Steps for Producing Publications

The path toward publication will move along according to this cycle:

1. Propose idea and abstract to be added to this curated list.
2. The authorship team is identified for a topic. An authorship team may include organizations and individuals.
3. The authorship team organizes and publishes their ideas on this website as proof of concept research. This will allow flexibility to build ideas while sharing them in their transient state.
4. Once the idea has reached steady-state on this documentation website, it will be converted into a formal, technical white paper and published as free and open-source for the community's benefit.
