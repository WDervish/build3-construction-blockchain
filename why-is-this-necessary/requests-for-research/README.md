## Research Requests:

### Request 1 \[Submitted 12 April 2022]

<summary>Build3 Blockchain Adoption Roadmap and Challenges</summary>

#### Nominated Authorship Team:&#x20;

#### **\[awaiting nomination]**

### Abstract

A proposed publication to discuss the roadmap for implementing a public utility supervision blockchain. This research would discover the full road map in a logical order from easiest to most difficult to implement. An example features road map may look like this:

1. **Professional Licensure Authorship:** Cryptographic Signatures representing Architectural and Engineering Seals. This functions as the start of the identity network as well (proof of licensee).
2. **Construction Submittals:** Cryptographically signed by the issuer and signed by the reviewer(s)
3. **Permitting:** Permits signed on-chain by the submitting parties and signed by the approving authority having jurisdiction. This topic also requires thinking about the International Building Code, Chapter 1, or other codes are written that address permitting requirements.
4. **Inspections:** Similar to permitting, but for proof of the state of inspection.
5. **Maintenance:**  This may be discussed as an interoperable parachain on the Polkdatot network or some other parachain based network that could share state and security with the build3 network.
6. **Property Identity:** The contributions from the build3 network related to proof of supervision would be identity markers about a specific property. Each renovation from start to end of a building would contain the proof of supervision process that helped to secure the safety of the building itself. This would have insurability implications worth researching.
7. **GIS Maps:** Proof of supervision of land survey work which would be tied directly to the public GIS map systems.

<summary>Labor Based Based Voting Authority</summary>

#### Nominated Authorship Team:&#x20;

#### **Phillip Brock, Author**

**Ken Shultz, Editor**

### **Abstract**

Blockchain enthusiasts usually tout the benefits of decentralization. Unfortunately, many of the features baked into the technology ultimately lead to a re-centralization in myriad ways. A small [central group of miner farms](https://www.sunbirddcim.com/infographic/largest-bitcoin-mining-farms-world) generally controls all rewards on the bitcoin network. When it comes to voting mechanisms, most involve the spending of coins, which makes voter authority directly proportional to their access to funds.&#x20;

A proposed solution to this problem involves removing or reducing the possibility of exponential relationships from voting power. Non-transferrable voting tokens are issues based on a user's contribution to the network. You earn voting tokens as you review, submit, or otherwise interact with the system. These tokens are non-transferrable, would be burned when used for voting, and may expire after some time. This paper will explore these ideas and propose technical standards for developers to implement as a pallet on the chain. This voting token introduces a new token that is not nonfungible (NFT) nor technically wholly fungible.

<summary>Why Authorship Matters in Construction Administration</summary>

#### Nominated Authorship Team:&#x20;

#### **\[awaiting nomination]**

### **Abstract**

Construction drawings generally require submittals such as product data, shop drawings, product samples, and other elements. Each contractor on the job must submit the specified deliverables in order to conform to the specifications of the supervised construction documents.&#x20;

We currently have no way to determine whether the architect or engineer is reviewing the exact same information submitted by the author (usually a trade contractor).\
\
The submittals are tied to the construction project and are signed by the issuer(s) as well as the reviewers(s). The designer of record has proof that the author of the submittal is the contractor performing the work, and the contractor has proof that the engineer of record is the author of the review or approval.

This mechanism also provides proof of compliance with specifications. It is now possible to prove if submittals were given to and approved by appropriate supervising authorities before construction was permitted.&#x20;

The public authorship proof lends to transparency and accountability in this system would increase the likelihood of code-compliant installation ultimately having the effect of increasing security for building occupants.

<summary>Cryptographic Certificate of Occupancy<br>Submitted</summary>

#### Nominated Authorship Team:&#x20;

#### **\[awaiting nomination]**

### **Abstract**

With architectural and engineering seals, Construction Administration, permit review and approval, and inspections authorship proofs resolved, it isn't a stretch of the mind to consider the Certificate of Occupancy itself as fundamental to the blockchain. The building design and construction cycle would be tied together with minimal disruption to existing workflows, directly to the Occupancy Certificate.

This new cryptographic token will tie to the building identity and introduce new features for a certificate of occupancy that could never have previously existed. This topic encourages the authors' imagination to explore those new features and document them as formal technical specifications.

<summary>Five Reasons Blockchain Will Make Everything Worse<br>Submitted</summary>

#### Nominated Authorship Team:&#x20;

#### \[awaiting nomination]

### **Abstract**

The purpose of this research is to dig deeply into those advocating strongly against blockchain technology, and web3 in general, for ethical, economic, social, or other notable concerns. This will encourage our organization to understand the existential threats technology presents. With those threats identified, Build3 can work to resolve or mitigate them within the protocol.

This paper is particularly interesting as it poses a great threat to Build3 claims and may serve to disprove them and dismantle the work completed to date to advance the technology. That being said, it's better to learn that sooner than later.

<summary>Legal Context: Connecting On-Chain Governance to State-Recognized Paper Bylaws</summary>

Nominated Authorship Team:&#x20;

#### Kenneth Shultz, PE - Author

\[awaiting nomination] - Editor

### **Abstract**

This paper will explore traditional bylaw language for registered 503(c) organizations, and work to adapt them such that they can be updated through the blockchain governance. The final bylaws, once approved by the board of directors, will be published as part of the research and be registered with the State Corporation Commission. The bylaws will also be formally instantiated on-chain through the on-chain governance mechanisms.&#x20;

The language should be worded in such a way that all future changes to the bylaws shall be registered through the blockchain protocols. There should be considerations for catastrophic failure in the chain to compensate for the risk of early adoption. For example: in the event of a catastrophic failure, the acting authorities of the organization may adopt new bylaws through traditional means. Those means must be registered to the blockchain once the network failure has been resolved.

The purpose is to both finalize the Build3 Bylaws and publish findings for future organizations to use in consultation with their legal representation.

## How to Publish with Build3 Foundation

The path toward publication will move along according to this cycle:

1. **Topic Nomination:** A topic is nominated for consideration by the Build3 Foundation. The submitting party may nominate themselves.&#x20;
2. **Author Nomination:** The topic proposal will be listed for up to one week. It may be removed if no author and editor are nominated within that time period.
3. **Maximum Topics Listed:** Only ten research requests may be posted at a time.
4. **Topic Removal:** Once either 1.) at least one author and one editor have accepted the nomination and have committed to a publication deadline, or 2.) the listing has expired, the topic is removed from the Research Requests page.&#x20;
5. **Research Development:** The topic is then moved to the Active Research Projects page.&#x20;
   1. Where the research progress must be updated a minimum of once weekly to allow for user review and comment. The authorship team is under no obligation to accept comments from the community on the work. This allows for other members to engage in the progress and give the authors constructive feedback during the process.
6. **Steady-State:** The documentation must be declared as in 'steady state' meaning no significant changes to claims, or conclusions are permitted for this research period.&#x20;
   1. Steady-state must be declared at least two weeks prior to the formal publication deadline.&#x20;
7. **Finalizing the Publication:** The research team used the time between steady-state and the deadline to formalize their findings in a technical white paper.
   1. The final paper will be submitted to the network for approval. Comments may be submitted, but the authors are under no obligation to address them.
   2. If approved, be publication will be published as free and open-source (granting rights to the public to print, distribute, and make derivative work, without limitation) to the Build3 Foundation research repository.
