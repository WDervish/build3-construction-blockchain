# ðŸ›« PermitZIP: Two-Week Project

## Introduction

[PermitZIP](https://www.permitzip.com) offers a solution to the engineering world for a small project which is to provide a two-week turnaround. There are strict rules to follow for that to work on all fronts; one that often catches PermitZIP off guard is allowing a project to kick off before it should.

## Standard of Care Game

The biggest missing link is the sales team's knowledge of the required technical information to kick off into design. How do they know if the product data for the restaurant is to standard? How do they know if the architectural record documents have enough information for engineering judgment?&#x20;

The same standard of care approach from the [Proof of Supervision with Blockchain](proof-of-supervision-with-blockchain.md) case is proposed.  With the help of the sales team, a client follows the standard of care to prepare for kickoff.

This documentation, for example, includes:

* Completed Survey&#x20;
* Cut sheets for special equipment
* Architectural PDF (of the actual building)
* Special equipment layout
* DWG or Revit files
* Signed proposal
* Special project-related specifications (franchises, etc)

They sign each transaction when they submit the required records. These records are reviewed by the sales team and authorized for final approval by the engineering production managers.&#x20;

When all conditions are met, the two-week process begins and is documented on the blockchain smart contract.
