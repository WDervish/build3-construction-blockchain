# ðŸ”­ Introduction

## What to Expect

This section is dedicated to proposed use-cases with reference to a technical pallet implementation from the [substrate](https://substrate.io) framework.&#x20;

Some are living in the source code, some are only conceptual. Each idea will vary in its development and is expected to grow in depth as contributors work through them.

## Legend

You will see the note blocks as you read through the use cases. They each represent the level of development of the idea into the source code. They are defined as:

{% hint style="success" %}
Stable Deployment.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Working in Development.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Theory-based Idea. This means it can be implemented but hasn't made it into the production pipeline yet.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Abstract Idea: Requires high levels of customization or implementation method is unknown.
{% endhint %}

Alright, let's dive in...
