# ðŸŒ„ Introduction

## The Authorship Dilemma

The growing gap between the physical and digital worlds exposes a growing existential threat to construction. Simply put: we can't prove who authored the documents, yet we use them to build high-rise buildings.\
\
Offices all over the world throughout the supply chain copy, forward, upload, and attach documents generally trusted as the true copy of the licensed professional's instructions.

We purchase, fabricate, ship, install, commission, inspect, and approve occupancy certificates for bridges, buildings, and roads with nothing more than a dose of trust. We trust that nothing was corrupted from the original instructions along the entire supply chain of decisions.

The Build3 Foundation blockchain solves the proof of authorship dilemma, and we need your help.

## Who We Are

We are a member-governed research and development blockchain foundation.&#x20;

â€‹Our blockchain is designed to function as an authorship-proof layer for the construction industry. This can start as early as feasibility work and extends to the certificate of occupancy. Each certificate of occupancy issued to each building, including the initial build and all subsequent renovations will be tied to it.

These certificates persist as immutable records to serve the public for the life of the building. They offer assurance that the construction performed was done so under the direct supervision and control of a qualified professional. Ultimately, at the end of a building's lifetime, when demolished, the certificates serve as historical artifacts to the land itself.
