# ðŸŒ„ Introduction

The engineering and construction industry has taken some steps towards modernizing the means and methods of the trades, but there is quite a gap that needs to be bridged between the current infrastructure and the inevitable future of the global economy. Let's dive in.

## Who We Are

We are engineers, architects, mathematicians, organizations, businesses, and other professionals. We are tenants, landlords, lawyers, insurers, investors, contractors, marketers. We are anyone who interacts with buildings in any form.

Until recently, there has been no way to verify the authorship, ownership, and authenticity of any digital works produced. This ambiguity in proof of authorship is of particular concern in an industry which relies heavily on professional supervision (entirely in a digital world) of creating buildings and machines (entirely in the physical world).&#x20;

The increasingly divergent digital and physical worlds in the construction industry pose a risk to public safety, health, and welfare. The ethical codes of our industry obliged us to secure that network.

The work of build3 foundation includes a proof of concept protocol demonstrating the means to secure our building network for the first time in our industry since the dawn of the digital age. Doing so means that, by extension, this new protocol secures building occupants (public safety, health, and welfare).&#x20;

This protocol is all possible due to the recent breakthroughs in blockchain technology, most notably the work of the [Web3 Foundation](https://web3.foundation)[ ](https://web3.foundation)and [Dr. Gavin Wood,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin\_Wood) who released [this paper](https://polkadot.network/PolkaDotPaper.pdf).â€‹

The build3 foundation believes that failing to close the gap between the virtual and built environments fails to fulfill our obligation to hold paramount the public's safety, health, and welfare in our professional duties. \
â€‹\
All work of the build3 foundation will be made open-source for use in securing the safety, health, welfare of the public.&#x20;
