# ðŸŒ„ Introduction

The engineering and construction industry has taken some steps towards modernizing the means and methods of the trades, but there is quite a gap that needs to be bridged between the current infrastructure and the inevitable future of the global economy. Let's dive in.

## Who We Are

We are engineers, architects, mathematicians, organizations, businesses, and other professionals. We are tenants, landlords, lawyers, insurers, investors, contractors, and marketers. We are anyone who interacts with buildings in any form and bears the responsibility and liability for the safety and welfare of a building's inhabitants.

We are in an industry that requires professional supervision in the digital world to administer the building of physical structures. There should be no ambiguity regarding the authorship, ownership, and authenticity of the construction documents used to build occupiable structures.

The increasingly divergent digital and physical worlds in the construction industry pose a risk to public safety, health, and welfare. We have an ethical and practical obligation to ensure that the network in which these documents are produced, released, and distributed is secured.

build3 Foundation has developed a proof of concept protocol to demonstrate how to secure the digital foundation of the built world, and subsequently secure public safety, health and welfare.

This protocol is all possible due to the recent breakthroughs in blockchain technology, most notably the work of the [Web3 Foundation](https://web3.foundation)[ ](https://web3.foundation)and [Dr. Gavin Wood,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin\_Wood) who released [this paper](https://polkadot.network/PolkaDotPaper.pdf).â€‹

Bridging the gap between the virtual and built environments is absolutely essential to fulfill our professional and human obligation to the public's safety, health, and welfare.\

All work of the build3 foundation will be made open-source. Our responsibility is shared, and progress relies on cooperation.
